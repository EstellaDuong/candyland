ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This project implements an interactive board game fashioned after the game
Candy Land, but with some unique twists. It can be a played with multiple 
players, where each player's goal is to journey across the map to be the first 
to reach the castle in order to win. On the way, players can shop for 
candies, use special abilities, encounter obstacles, find hidden treasures, 
and complete other quests while interacting with other players. Players are 
guided through a world of candies and adventure.
